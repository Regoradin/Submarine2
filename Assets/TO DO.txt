TODO:

Modeling:
fix flipped faces on test sub: boxes, top hatch, walls to cargo area.
Make torpedoes
Make/find a gun turret of some sort to put on top

Code:
Figure out how to do movement constraint/modification (sitting in chairs or going up ladders), switch to a rigidbody based model perhaps?

Character rigidbody: spinning on contact with walls, falling slower than the sub.

Do center of mass manually for the sub to prevent tipping.
